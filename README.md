# Tymer

A Clock application made in flutter.

## set up Flutter SDK on your machine

In order to use tymer in the current state that it is in you must install [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/):link: before testing it. I have put a link to the [Flutter SDK](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install):link: here.

> if you need help installing Flutter here is a helpful guilde that you can use. ["How to install Flutter on Windows 2024"](https://youtu.be/mMeQhLGD-og?si=Zdw5x0srp8CpUHZc):link:

## Running the app

Once you have the [Flutter SDK](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install):link: installed you can run app using the [Flutter CLI](https://docs.flutter.dev/reference/flutter-cli):link:. Use ``` flutter run ``` command in the tserminal.

```console
flutter run
```
